> **Challenge 2: Retrieve Customer Sales Revenue**
Each Adventure Works customer is a retail company with a named contact. You must create queries that
return the total revenue for each customer, including the company and customer contact names.

Tip: Review the documentation for the WITH common_table_expression syntax in the Transact-SQL

that customer. Use a derived table or a common table expression to retrieve the details for each sales
order, and then query the derived table or CTE to aggregate and group the data.
